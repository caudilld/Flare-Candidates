This repository contains light curves and data regarding the study conducted in the research note titled "M-Dwarf Flare Candidates Simultaneously Observed by K2 and TESS".

Each folder contains a at least two light curves for each target flagged with a flaring event. Files titled #T indicate TESS data and #K indicates K2 data.

Overlap plots are included for those which were clearly defined by TESS, but not seen by K2. while ** indicates K2 detections that we believe to be extraneous based on lack of substanstial supporting evidence.

Finally a .csv is included with the information for all targets observed in this study.
