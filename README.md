This repository contains light curves and data regarding the study conducted in the research note titled "M-Dwarf Flare Candidates Simultaneously Observed by K2 and TESS".

Each folder contains a at least two light curves (produced outputs from PyVAN (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AJ....158..119L/abstract, https://github.com/kdlawson/pyvan), modfied to easily distinguish between K2/TESS data) for each target flagged with a flaring event. Files titled #T indicate TESS data and #K indicates K2 data.

Overlap plots are included for those which were clearly defined by TESS, but not seen by K2. 

Targets 11, 20, 27, and 28 saw K2 detections that we believe to be false positives based on lack of structure and substanstial supporting evidence from TESS.

Finally a .csv is included with the information for all targets observed in this study.
